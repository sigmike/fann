This python binding is provided by Vincenzo Di Massa <hawk.it@tiscalinet.it>
and Gil Megidish <gil@megidish.net>

MAKE
Make sure to make the fann library first. You are required to have
swig and python development files installed. After you compiled the
fann library, run make with the apropriate makefile (gnu or msvc.) 
Running build.bat will create a distribution for Windows platform. For
that, you will need py2exe installed.

NOTE
Two makefiles are provided. The GNU makefile will create a shared object
for use in GNU/cygwin environments. The MSVC makefile will create a dll
for the official Python distribution. Importing a dll made with cygwin
in a standard distribution will cause python to hang.

ANOTHER NOTE
MSVC makefile does not compile fann sources by itself. This is done, as
of the moment, by compiling them manually. This should go into the setup.py,
as python supports compilation of C code, using extension tags. Due the
demand of this release, it has been postponed to a future version. One last
note, there isn't really a need for libfann.py. It will be removed next
version.

USAGE
Just import fann.
